## Key Questions and Objectives
    
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and    
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are    
the main questions they’d like to answer:    
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?    
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?    
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?    
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?    
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?   
  
## Dataset

I’ll be using a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.
