## Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

### Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a film distributor that used to have branches all over the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,Rockbuster Stealth's management team plans to use its existing film licences to launch an online video rental service to remain competitive. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.
    
### Key Questions and Objectives
    
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and    
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are    
the main questions they’d like to answer:    
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?    
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?    
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?    
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?    
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?   
  
### Dataset

I’ll be using a data set that contains information about Rockbuster’s
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.
